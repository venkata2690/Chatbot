Traditional data analysis involves searching for established patterns  and keywords in limited data sets, then performing operations on the  result. But IBM Watson is leading a watershed shift to digital  intelligence: finding meaning by discovering previously unseen patterns,  drawing new inferences, and identifying new relationships from vast  amounts of data. At Watson we can transform companies and disrupt entire  markets by building cognitive thinking into every application we build,  using systems that learn to power enterprises that learn.
